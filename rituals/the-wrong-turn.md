# The Wrong Turn Ritual

**Intent:** Practice embracing mistakes as discovery opportunities and reducing fear of being wrong.

**Script:**
1. Once per week, deliberately take a wrong turn (literal or metaphorical)
2. Try a new route home, order something unfamiliar, ask a question you "should" know
3. Pay attention to what you discover in the deviation
4. Record one unexpected thing you learned or experienced
5. Share it with someone else as a "beautiful mistake"

**Words (when you realize you're "wrong"):**
> "Ah, interference. What are you trying to teach me?"

**Evidence plan:** Collect stories of serendipitous discoveries and measure increased comfort with uncertainty.

**Safety:** Choose safe contexts for wrong turns (no dangerous physical risks).
