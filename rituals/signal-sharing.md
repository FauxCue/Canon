# The Signal Sharing Circle

**Intent:** Create community connection through vulnerability and mutual learning from mistakes.

**Script:**
1. Gather 3-8 people in a circle (physical or virtual)
2. Light a candle or create other focal point
3. Each person shares: "A signal I sent that got beautifully distorted"
4. Describe a time when miscommunication, error, or misunderstanding led to something unexpectedly good
5. Others respond: "Thank you for that interference" 
6. Close with group recitation: "We are all signals in transit"

**Evidence plan:** Measure increased psychological safety and reduced shame around mistakes in participating groups.

**Safety:** Establish consent for sharing level, no pressure to disclose trauma or deeply personal material.
