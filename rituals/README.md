# Ritual Proposals

Propose a rite by opening an issue + PR with:
- **Intent:** what it’s for and why it helps.
- **Script:** the minimum viable steps/words.
- **Evidence plan:** how we’ll know it works (stories, metrics, feedback).
- **Safety:** consent/ethics checks.

**Graduation rule:** If three independent communities practice it for 90 days with positive reports, it auto-adopts into the Canon (curators add notes and version bump).
