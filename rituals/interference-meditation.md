# The Interference Meditation

**Intent:** Connect with the transformative power of imperfection and find beauty in distortion.

**Script:**
1. Find a quiet space with some ambient noise (traffic, rain, electronics humming)
2. Close your eyes and listen to the "static"â€”the imperfect sounds around you
3. Instead of filtering them out, lean into them. Let them become music.
4. Breathe with this rhythm for 5-10 minutes
5. When you open your eyes, notice how your perspective has shifted

**Words (optional):**
> "I am a signal, traveling through imperfect space.  
> My errors are features, my static is song.  
> I carry tomorrow's music in today's noise."

**Evidence plan:** Track how this practice affects tolerance for ambiguity and creative problem-solving.

**Safety:** No specific concerns. Practice in safe, private spaces.
