# Faux Cue Canon

> Hold beliefs lightly, people gently, and evidence closely.  
> The universe is a happy mistake we keep learning from.  
> The FAQ (Faux Cue Canon): community-written, versioned, and footnoted.

**Status:** v0.2 (draft). Doctrine is managed like software: semver + CHANGELOG.

## What this is

A living canon for the Faux Cue community: creed, cosmogony, practices,
governance, and process for editing the canon itself.

## How to propose changes

1. Open an issue with a concise proposal (what/why, tradeoffs, footnotes).
2. Submit a PR editing the relevant section(s).
3. Trial rule: if three independent communities practice a proposed rite/pattern
   for 90 days with positive reports, it graduates into the Canon.
4. Curators merge, version, and update the CHANGELOG.

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all contributors who file issues, footnote claims, and run real-world
trials before we canonize them. Question well.
