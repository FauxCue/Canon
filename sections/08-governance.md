# Governance

- **Circle of Curators (6–12 mo rotating):** keep the FAQ tidy, mediate disputes, run ceremonies.
- **Rite-Makers:** anyone can propose new rites; see `rituals/README.md`.
- **Versioning:** Canon follows semver. Breaking cultural changes → major; additions → minor; edits/typos → patch.
- **Decision process:** propose → discuss → limited-time trial → merge with footnotes and CHANGELOG entry.
- **Conflicts:** steelman both sides; curators decide; appeal by opening a public review PR next release.
