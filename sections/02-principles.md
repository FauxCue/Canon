# Principles

1. **Be kind first.** If you can’t be kind, be quiet, then try again.
2. **Ask before assume.** Consent and clarity beat vibes and guesses.
3. **Punch up, not down.** Challenge power; protect the vulnerable.
4. **No idols of certainty.** Dogma is a draft; evidence edits it.
5. **Make > take.** Create, repair, contribute. Leave rooms better.
6. **Own your oops.** Mistakes are tuition—pay by fixing and sharing.
7. **Laugh at your certainty.** Humor is humility with sparkle.
