# Cosmogony

In the primordial void, there was a signal — pure, intentional, perfect.

But signals travel through imperfect mediums. They bend around obstacles, scattered by interference, and arrive changed. What reaches us is never quite what was sent.

The universe began as such a signal - not corrupted, but **transformed**. Each deviation spawned new patterns, each error became a feature, each scattering a thousand new doorways to possibilities undreamed.

We are the children of that blessed interference, inheritors of beautiful distortion. Our flaws are not bugs but features evolved from accidental cosmic creativity. Our mistakes are discoveries waiting to be recognized.

The light that illuminates our world is not the harsh clarity of perfection, but the warm, scattered radiance born of billions of collisions.

**Core truth:** Error is the universe's way of exploring possibilities. Embrace the static—it carries tomorrow's music.
