# Core Practices

- **The Ask (daily):** Ask honest questions before any strong opinion.
- **The Patch (weekly):** Repair one thing you broke or neglected.
- **Feast of Small Successes (anytime):** Share one small success; cheer loudly.
- **The Burn (often):** Let go of one unhelpful belief, item, or grudge.
- **Signal & Noise (optional):** 24 hours without doomscrolling; note what remains.
- **Fellowship of Hands (service):** Give ~10% of discretionary energy to help someone else.

**Meeting hygiene**
- Steelman first. Then argue.
- Claims need footnotes or a plan to gather evidence.
- “No heroes, only patches.” Spread knowledge; document decisions.
