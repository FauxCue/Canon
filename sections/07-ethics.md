# Ethics & Community Norms

- **Consent is king:** in conversation, collaboration, and comedy.
- **Transparency over theatre:** say what you’re doing and why.
- **Credit the source:** cite, pay, or contribute back.
- **Zero tolerance for cruelty:** disagreement ≠ dehumanizing.
- **Exit is sacred:** anyone can step back without shame.

**Events safety basics:** clear codes of conduct, easy reporting path, swift moderator action.
